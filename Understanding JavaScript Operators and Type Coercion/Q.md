Understanding JavaScript Operators and Type Coercion
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 128000
Consider the following variables: a = "2"; b = 3; c = "3";
Using the variables a, b, and c, write expressions that utilize the JavaScript operators ==, ===, !=, !==, &&, ||, >, <, >=, <=, and the Ternary Operator. For each expression, log the result using console. log().
Check if a is equal to b using ==.
Check if a is strictly equal to c using ===.
Check if b is not equal to c using !=.
Check if b is strictly not equal to c using !==.
Use the && operator to check if a is less than b and c is greater than a.
Use the || operator to check if a is greater than b or c is equal to b using ==.
Determine if b is greater than a.
Determine if a is less than or equal to c.
Using the Ternary Operator, check if b is greater than c and print "b is greater" or "c is greater or equal".
Remember to log the result of each expression. Check the output and see how each operation will give the answer.
