## 🏝️ Atlantis

**⏱ Time Limit:** 2
**💾 Memory Limit:** 128000

🔑 **We have a key as follows:**
`v3 + v2 + v4 + v3 + v5 + v2 + v1 + v6`

### 🎯 Task

Your task is to **ONLY declare** the above variables and **assign relevant characters** to them so that, when concatenated one after the other according to the above key, it results in the string:

```
ATLANTIS
```

---

### 📥 Input

nothing is given in input

### 📤 Output

output should result in:

```
ATLANTIS Found!
```

---

### 💡 Example

Assign the values to each variable such that when concatenated, they form the string **"ATLANTIS"**.

```javascript
v1 = 'T'
v2 = 'A'
v3 = 'L'
v4 = 'N'
v5 = 'I'
v6 = 'S'
```

Thus, the sequence will become:

```
"L" + "A" + "N" + "L" + "I" + "A" + "T" + "S" = "LANLIATS"
```

which is ❌ **not equal** to the required string.
