Atlantis
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 128000
We have a key as follows
v3 + v2 + v4 + v3 + v5 + v2 + v1 + v6
Task
Your task is to ONLY declare above variables and assign relavant characters to them so that, when concatenated one after other according to above key, it results in the string ATLANTIS.
Input
nothing is given in input
Output
output should result in ATLANTIS Found!
Example
Assign the values to each variable such that when concatenated, they form the string "ATLANTIS".
Example

v1 = 'A'
v2 = 'T'
v3 = 'L'
v4 = 'A'
v5 = 'N'
v6 = 'S'
Thus, the sequence will become:
"L" + "T" + "A" + "L" + "N" + "T" + "A" + "S" = "LTANLNTA"
which is not equal to the required string.
