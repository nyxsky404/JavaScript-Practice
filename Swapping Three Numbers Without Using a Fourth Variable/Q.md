## 🔄 Swapping Three Numbers Without Using a Fourth Variable

**⏱ Time Limit:** 2
**💾 Memory Limit:** 128000

You are provided with three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Your task is to swap their values cyclically **without using any additional variables** (such as a fourth temporary variable). Specifically:

👉 Assign the value of `a` to `b`,
👉 Assign the value of `b` to `c`, and
👉 Assign the value of `c` to `a`.

You must achieve this using **arithmetic operations** or other suitable techniques.

🖨 **Output the swapped values of `a`, `b`, and `c`**, each on a separate new line using `console.log()`.

> ✨ Variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are already initialized, you can directly use them.
