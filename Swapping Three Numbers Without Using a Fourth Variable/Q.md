Swapping Three Numbers Without Using a Fourth Variable
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 128000
You are provided with three variables: a, b, and c. Your task is to swap their values cyclically without using any additional variables (such as a fourth temporary variable). Specifically:

Assign the value of a to b,
Assign the value of b to c, and
Assign the value of c to a.
You must achieve this using arithmetic operations or other suitable techniques.
Output the swapped values of a, b, and c, each on a seprate new line using console.log().


variables  'a', b' and 'c' are already initialised you can directly use them

Input
The first line of input will contain three space-separated integers a, b, and c (Given).
Output
Output the swapped values of a, b, and c, each on a new line.
Example
Input:
1 2 3
Output:
3
1
