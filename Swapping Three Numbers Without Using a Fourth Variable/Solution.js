/*
You can assume the given three variables as a, b, c
For eg. a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
then after running your code, resultant should be a = 3, b = 1, c = 2;
Further you need to print the values of a, b, and c in the console, each in the new line respectively.
*/

// write your code here


// let a = 1
// let b = 2
// let c = 3

a = a +b +c
b = a - (b +c)
c = a - (b+c)
a = a - (b+c)

console.log(a)
